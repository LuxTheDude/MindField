Verse 1:
“You must not lay your eyes
On the undoings of the world
It will drag you down deep, deep
Sorrow and despair surrounds us 
darkens our confident souls”
Don’t mourn the dead, but rejoice

Chorus 1:
Look to the sky for grace
Symmetry and bliss
Take this broken world
Make of it what you can

Verse 2:
I'm too afraid to live
but I’m so afraid to die
Terrified of what may come
So scared of all, not to lie
desenthesized, paralyzed
Don’t mourn the dead, but rejoice

Chorus 2:
Look to your home for peace
Raging wars can't 
close its bloody hand
Make of it what you can

Verse 3:
Seconds lasts for days
And days Blur together for years
Sleep is not for the nights
Merely fuels my fears

How can i believe
In you and then take a leap?
And how should i believe
When i don’t believe in myself?   

Do you feel the hate
From the war you create?
the sky is raining fire
it burns for your desire

Chorus 3:
Look to the sky for grace
Symmetry and bliss
dont mourn the dead
celebrate the lives they gave
