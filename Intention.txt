Verse 1:
Heres an action to understand
Believe me when i say im not one to demand
but still it doesn't work itself out
And when you reveal my intention
you give me the wrong impression  

Chorus 1:
You know me better than most
There is a show in my mind and your the host
the audience gives you an applause
You bow and feel on top of your game
but let me tell you the shortness of fame

Verse 2:
you make the world slip away
control of my mind trapped in your game

Verse 2 - Heavy:
my night terror
my omniscient
my narrator pulling my string
intoxicate
control my mind 
i want the power, leave you behind

Chorus 2:
You control me you're my host
We had the time of our lives, we were better than most
the audience laugh they wanna have more
therefore you will dig into my core
you want my power that is your dream
