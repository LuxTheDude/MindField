Verse 1:
living in this state of depression
stuck in this cage i can't move on
want to let the freezing winter wind in 
I want to feel the shivering cold

Verse 1 (Modulated):
to supress my pain
i got a temptation
she came to me
and freed me from my chain

Pre-Chorus 1:
it's boiling down in me
i feel it in my veins
just tell me when it kicks in

Chorus 1:
i'm numb again
like a lucid dream
don't wanna be sober

Verse 2:
addicted to this state of vanished problems
and when the problems come back
i'll take another hit then become numb
breathing through a straw of snow
winter takes it's toll
there's no light in this tunnel
this is the moment to take me away

Pre-Chorus 2:
it's firing up in me
it's burning through my veins
now i know when it kicks in

Chorus 2:
i'm numb again
like a lucid dream
don't wanna be sober

Bridge:
In this divine moment
I'm shivering
From the cold night
how did i get so fated now
father take my hand
i guess it's my time
