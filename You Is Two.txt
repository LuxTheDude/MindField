Verse 1 (A):

location is a fickle substance
you do not stand a single chance
locating you is not a riddle
but where am i
(i) is two 
i is two
separate
face the truth

Chorus 1:
So
i'm trying to find
some kind of dissociation
but feel interconnected

No
i am not alone 
i am aware of this para-
doxical moment

Verse 2 (B):
peeping through this subtle 
haze of my own knowledge
stumbling through this complex
delusional cold maze

the distress is running
through my veins and stunning
my ability to
navigate my way through

Chorus 2:
So
i'm trying to find
some kind of dissociation
but feel interconnected

No
i am not alone
i am aware of this para-
doxical moment

Verse 3 (D):
localize and become wiser
find yourself a truth now
right now

you won't find anything 
that will help you cope with this perplex
seperate me

Chorus 3:
So
i'm trying to find
some kind of dissociation
but feel interconnected

No
i am not alone
i am aware of this para-
doxical moment
