Verse 1:
Waves become clear
Three souls are still here
lights gone brighter
Green and red appears 
The dawn of day
will soon arrive
Considering
are we still here?

Chorus 1:
Unknown is this, state of mind, abandon this vessel, take it all away
Consumption of these unknown matters thinking about what reality really is


C-stykke:
Black
Black and white
before my eye
Where am i? 
The dimension this tunnel leads to


Chorus 2:

enhancing fractals, live through these recursions, tracing, drifting away
distorting in this independent repetitive excursion
embrace eversion in this new reality




Verse 2:
Purple, numbers shreds the walls around

us is gone non excistential 
now we are one and one are us now
unlocking immortality
 
Outro: 
diving in this altered state
embracing this divinity
embracing this temporary death
breaking through 

universal rules
becoming one with infinity
take this enlightening 
experience and do it all again
