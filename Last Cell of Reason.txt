Verse 1:
You're all so diseased
the dirt is flooding in your blood
your fever's highly increased
your skin is burning hot
your ignorance freezes your brain
and your heart is pounding away
the last cell of reason is slain
this virus makes you decay  

ah ah ah
ah ah ah

Chorus 1:
mother did warn you
mother will fix this too
mother will mend her aches
mother will see this through
she screamed and moaned as one does in fear

Verse 2:
You're all the disease
feasting festering the host
and feeling so at ease
becoming the leeching ghosts
your ignorance freezes your minds
but this too will pass just like
your smiles when this world has declined
and you are the parasite

ah ah ah
ah ah ah

Chorus 2:
your mother did warn you
mother will fix this too
Mother will mend her aches
mother will see this through
she screamed and moaned as one does in fear
