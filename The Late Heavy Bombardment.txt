
Verse 1:

Crashing, into our existence
imploding, every last persistance

with a force greater than pessimism
from above a universal cataclysm

greetings, from the laws of death  
peeling, away the very last breath

Such a heavy bombardment

Chorus 1:

doomsdays mumbling calling you out here
someones watching
mountains crumbling matter disappears
heavy bombardment

Verse 2:

run away, and try to hide from
the cosmic reaper, searching for tonights prey

might this opening of pandoras box
really be the answer to the fermi paradox?

try and find some comfort in your womb
while you hear the bells of impending doom

Such a heavy bombardment

Chorus 2:

doomsdays mumbling calling you out here
someones watching
mountains crumbling matter disappears
gravitate to die

Chorus 3:

will it suffice to say that this is true
realm of man crushed (being alive)
destabilization of this world (is no longer a thing that you do)
fire, fire, fire will burn your eyes
compromise of the skies trivial despise
the end has begun
