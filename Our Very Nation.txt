Verse 1:

Another choice, yet another take
another decision to make
one more sight, one more day
one more reason to obey
democracy, and demolition
are devoted to decay in collision
blood on your hand, and blood on your knife
blood on your innocent life

Verse 2:

Another string,yet another catch
another promise that never lasts
One more lie, one more belief
one more holy god of grief
Interstellar, and overdriven
are designed to always be misgiven
old and dead, young and proud
writ of stone, but very loud

Chorus 1:

Heads held high for this holy land
You are to do what we demand
Heads held high for this holy land
This beauty you must understand

Stand in awe of our very nation
Look for us for your stimulation
Stand in awe of our very nation
We don't need another confrontation

Verse 3:
Another man, rules another land
has the power of who could and who can't
washing his hands, when they fall
dieing at the soldier ball
Redirection, and revolution
equals a faith of simple execution
the ministry of poverty
have the control of the facility 

Chorus 2:

Heads held high for this holy land
You are to do what we demand
Heads held high for this holy land
This beauty you must understand

Stand in awe of our very nation
Look for us for your stimulation
Stand in awe of our very nation
We don't need another confrontation

Chorus 3:

Heads held high for this holy land
You must go and make your stand
Heads held high for this holy land
Their forces you have to withstand

Stand in awe of our very nation
Look for them for your intoxication
Stand in awe of our very nation
It's time once more for confrontation
